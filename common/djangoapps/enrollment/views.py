            }

            **POST Parameters**

              A POST request can include the following parameters.

              * user: Optional. The username of the currently logged in user.
                You cannot use the command to enroll a different user.

              * mode: Optional. The course mode for the enrollment. Individual
                users cannot upgrade their enrollment mode from the default. Only
                server-to-server requests can enroll with other modes.

              * is_active: Optional. A Boolean value indicating whether the
                enrollment is active. Only server-to-server requests are
                allowed to deactivate an enrollment.

              * course details: A collection that includes the following
                information.

                  * course_id: The unique identifier for the course.

                this course.

              * enrollment_attributes: A dictionary that contains the following
                values.

                  * namespace: Namespace of the attribute

                  * value: Value of the attribute

              * is_active: Optional. A Boolean value that indicates whether the

                deactivate an enrollment.

              * mode: Optional. The course mode for the enrollment. Individual
                users cannot upgrade their enrollment mode from the default. Only
                server-to-server requests can enroll with other modes.

              * user: Optional. The user ID of the currently logged in user. You
                cannot use the command to enroll a different user.

        **GET Response Values**

            If an unspecified error occurs when the user tries to obtain a
            learner's enrollments, the request returns an HTTP 400 "Bad

            the requested learner, the request returns an HTTP 404 "Not Found"

        **POST Response Values**

             If the user does not specify a course ID, the specified course
             does not exist, or the is_active status is invalid, the request
             returns an HTTP 400 "Bad Request" response.

             If a user who is not an admin tries to upgrade a learner's course
             mode, the request returns an HTTP 403 "Forbidden" response.

             If the specified user does not exist, the request returns an HTTP
             406 "Not Acceptable" response.

        **GET and POST Response Values**

            If the request is successful, an HTTP 200 "OK" response is
            returned along with a collection of course enrollments for the
            user or for the newly created enrollment.
