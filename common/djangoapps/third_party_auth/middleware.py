        that's been requested is outside those modules, then flush the session.
        In general, this middleware should be used in cases where allowing the
        user to exit the running pipeline would be undesirable, and where it'd
        be better to flush the session state rather than allow it. Pipeline
        quarantining is utilized by the Enterprise application to enforce
        collection of user consent for sharing data with a linked third-party
        authentication provider.
