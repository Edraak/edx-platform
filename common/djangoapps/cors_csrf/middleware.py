"""
Middleware for handling CSRF checks with CORS requests


CSRF and referrer domain checks
-------------------------------

When processing HTTPS requests, the default CSRF middleware checks that the referer
domain and protocol is the same as the request's domain and protocol. This is meant
to avoid a type of attack for sites which serve their content with both HTTP and HTTPS,
with a man in the middle on the HTTP requests.

https://github.com/django/django/blob/b91c385e324f1cb94d20e2ad146372c259d51d3b/django/middleware/csrf.py#L117

This doesn't work well with CORS requests, which aren't vulnerable to this attack when
the server from which the request is coming uses HTTPS too, as it prevents the man in the
middle attack vector.

We thus do the CSRF check of requests coming from an authorized CORS host separately
in this middleware, applying the same protections as the default CSRF middleware, but
without the referrer check, when both the request and the referer use HTTPS.


CSRF cookie domains
-------------------

In addition, in order to make cross-domain AJAX calls to CSRF-protected end-points,
we need to send the CSRF token in the HTTP header of the request.

The simple way to do this would be to set the CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN to ".edx.org",
but unfortunately this can cause problems.  For example, suppose that
"first.edx.org" sets the cookie with domain ".edx.org", but "second.edx.org"
sets a cookie with domain "second.edx.org".  In this case, the browser
would have two different CSRF tokens set (one for each cookie domain),
which can cause non-deterministic failures depending on which cookie
is sent first.

For this reason, we add a second cookie that (a) has the domain set to ".edx.org",
but (b) does NOT have the same name as the CSRF_COOKIE_NAME.  Clients making
cross-domain requests can use this cookie instead of the subdomain-specific
CSRF cookie.
